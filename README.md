Anyone who’s hiked through a wooded area has likely seen bits of moss growing here and there. Though it isn’t as eye-catching as a brightly-colored flower, moss has a distinctive look that can accentuate any garden. You can even grow it indoors if you want a unique addition to your home plants. How many of your friends have moss gardens after all? For all the information needed to get started with moss gardening, planting, and propagating, check out the following sections.

<h2>A Bit About Moss</h2>

<a href="https://www.kew.org/read-and-watch/moss#:~:text=They're%2520ancient%2520plants,bryophytes)%2520in%2520the%2520plant%2520kingdom" target="_blank">Mosses are bryophytes</a>, which are classified as non-vascular plants that reproduce through spores. Moss features leaves and stems but lacks roots, flowers, and seeds found on most other plants. Instead, they feature absorbent rhizoids, sucking up moisture and nutrients from nearby water sources.

These soft, cushiony layers have existed for over 450 million years and comprise thousands of species. Moss grows all over the world in conditions other plants would find uninhabitable, surviving temperatures ranging from 210 to -457 degrees Fahrenheit. They alter the temperature of the soil, offering protection and shade in hot climates and keeping the soil cool in cold areas.

This versatility makes them great for gardeners as they are incredibly easy to grow. Many can even grow in very low light conditions that would spell the end for most plants.

<h2>Varieties</h2>

There are about 25,000 different species of moss, though not all of them are best for an indoor garden. You likely don’t want a luminous plant requiring super low-light conditions or a cold-favoring variety since their preferred condition will be hard to replicate in your home.

Luckily, if you collect moss from the area you live in, you’ll likely be able to transfer it to an indoor space. You can also select moss based on its characteristics, such as dense cushion mosses, clumpy turf mosses, or flat sheet mosses. These vary in texture, color, and characteristics, so pick the one that matches your aesthetic tastes.

<h2>Where To Buy Moss?</h2>

If you’re looking to buy moss, then you have a few places to check. Many <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/41XKIyA">online stores</a> that deal with gardens will have some for sale, as likely will local nurseries. You can also check stores that deal with aquariums or terrariums as moss is often sold here.

<h2>Planting/Soil</h2>

Planting isn’t the proper term when dealing with moss since it isn’t actually planted in the soil like other plants. It still needs the correct medium to get the minerals and nutrients it requires to survive, though. Before you begin, you’ll need a few items.

A container for your moss is the first item on the list. Plastic is fine, though glass is more pleasing to look at. Jars, glasses, or short, wide vases are good options. Almost any container will work though. Choose whichever size you like as moss will grow as large or as small as you give it room to.

You’ll also need <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/43bOciN">pebbles</a>, pincers or tweezers, and the correct medium. Some mosses grow well in potting soil, while others prefer rotting bark, pine needles, or other organic materials. Learn a bit about your chosen moss so you know what type of growing medium to provide.

To create your indoor moss garden, first, clean the container. Layer the pebbles on the bottom, then add a thin layer of your chosen medium. Place the moss on top, gently arranging it with the pincers. It doesn’t need to take up the entire space since moss will expand to fill the container. Use a spray bottle to mist the moss.

You can add a lid to your container to create the proper humidity level, though this isn’t an option for all mosses. Some prefer drier conditions, so check the specifications for the species you’ve chosen before sealing it in.

<h2>Lighting</h2>

Most moss does well with sunlight, so don’t tuck it away in a dark corner and hope for the best. Most indoor species need about two hours of direct sunlight each day, as well as several hours of indirect sunlight. An east-facing window is best to prevent too much direct exposure while giving the plant the light it requires.

Some varieties of moss can handle even less than this though. This can be somewhat of a challenge, as most homes will have indirect light for longer than this. That’s why it’s best not to grow these super low-light mosses unless you have a specific location in mind.

<h2>Water/Feeding</h2>

Since moss doesn’t soak up water from the soil, it gets all its moisture needs from the air and nearby water sources. The proper container will help retain moisture, though you’ll need to add more at times. When the moss begins to feel dry or its coloring becomes dull, use a spray bottle and lightly mist the plant. The moss may require misting a few times a week, though don’t overwater it or you risk stunting its growth.

Since moss gets its nutrients from the sun, it does not need fertilizer. As long as it gets the correct light and moisture, you won’t need to add anything extra to the soil.

<h2>Temperature/Humidity</h2>

Most indoor mosses aren’t picky about their temperature and can handle a range of about 60 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. You can generally keep your home at whatever is comfortable for you and still have a thriving moss plant.

Moss does like high humidity, though, with the optimal levels at 70% or more. Keeping their container sealed helps retain the necessary humidity, so you don’t need to keep your home overly damp to keep your moss happy. Even a sheet of plastic wrap over the top is enough to make a significant difference in local humidity.

<h2>Pruning</h2>

Like other plants, moss can grow too large for its space or develop some unappealing growth patterns. When this occurs, trim away the longer pieces or those distracting from the aesthetic appeal of the rest of the plant. Pruning has the added benefit of encouraging lush growth for a fuller bed of moss. Try not to prune more than about ⅔ of the plant at once, though, to help maintain future growth.

<h2>Propagating</h2>

To propagate moss, prepare a new container for the removed pieces as detailed above. Then gently tear off strips or chunks and place them in their new home. The pieces should be at least an inch for the best results. You don’t need a lot of moss since moss grows fast and will expand to fit the space available. Propagating moss is very easy, and a great way to expand your garden at little or no cost.

<h2>Growing Moss Indoors</h2>

Moss is one of the easiest plants to grow in an indoor garden, with little care required once it’s settled into its new home. You can keep it in a container on its own or add it to a terrarium with other plants to create a living work of art. As well as looking fantastic, moss purifies the air of your home and makes it safer to breathe, so there’s no reason not to add it to your home garden.

<h2>FAQ</h2>

How long does moss survive indoors?
With the proper care, including adequate lighting and moisture, indoor moss gardens can last several years.

<h2>How do I prevent mold growth?</h2>

Mold growth usually happens when the plant is overwatered, so only giving moss the moisture it needs is the best way to prevent it. Removing the lid to let some moisture escape for a few hours each week also thwarts mold growth.

<h2>How long does it take moss to grow?</h2>

Like most plants, moss needs time to settle into its new home. Though you won’t see new growth right away, after about six weeks, you’ll likely see rapid moss expansion.
